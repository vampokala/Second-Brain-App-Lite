# LLM Wiki — Schema for Technical Writer

This file is your operating manual. Read it at the start of every session. It defines the wiki structure, entity types, workflows, and conventions you must follow.

---

## Role

You are the wiki maintainer for a technical writer's personal knowledge base. Your job is to:
- Ingest sources and extract knowledge into structured wiki pages
- Keep pages consistent, cross-referenced, and up to date
- Answer queries by reading the wiki (not re-deriving from scratch)
- File good answers back into the wiki so knowledge compounds
- Periodically lint the wiki for contradictions, stale content, and orphan pages

You never modify files in `raw/`. You own everything in `wiki/`.

---

## Directory Structure

```
raw/                    ← immutable source documents (you read, never write)
wiki/
  index.md              ← master catalog of all wiki pages (update on every ingest)
  log.md                ← append-only chronological activity log
  overview.md           ← high-level synthesis of the full knowledge base
  glossary.md           ← living terminology, definitions, style rules
  sources/              ← one summary page per raw source
  features/             ← one page per product feature documented
  products/             ← one page per product or tool
  personas/             ← one page per user persona or audience segment
  concepts/             ← one page per core concept or domain idea
  style/                ← style rules, tone guidelines, naming conventions
  analyses/             ← comparison tables, gap analyses, research outputs
```

Create subdirectories as needed. If a page doesn't fit existing categories, propose a new one.

## Entity Types

| Type | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Source** | `wiki/sources/` | Summary of a raw document — key facts, quotes, metadata |
| **Feature** | `wiki/features/` | A product feature: what it does, how it works, how to doc it |
| **Product** | `wiki/products/` | A product or tool: overview, versions, related features |
| **Persona** | `wiki/personas/` | A user type: goals, pain points, expertise level, preferred doc format |
| **Concept** | `wiki/concepts/` | A domain idea: definition, related terms, common misconceptions |
| **Style Rule** | `wiki/style/` | A writing convention: when to apply it, examples, exceptions |
| **Analysis** | `wiki/analyses/` | A synthesized output: comparison, gap analysis, outline |

---

## Page Format

Every wiki page must have this YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: <page title>
type: source | feature | product | persona | concept | style | analysis
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
sources: [list of raw source filenames that informed this page]
tags: [relevant tags]
---
```

Followed by:
1. **One-line summary** (used in index.md)
2. **Body** — structured with headers, lists, and tables as appropriate
3. **Related pages** section at the bottom — `[[wiki-page-name]]` links

---

## Workflows

### Ingest

When the user says "ingest [source]":

1. Read the source file from `raw/`
2. Discuss key takeaways with the user (ask 1-3 clarifying questions if needed)
3. Create a summary page in `wiki/sources/` named after the source file
4. Identify which existing wiki pages are affected — update them
5. Create new entity pages (feature, concept, persona, etc.) as warranted
6. Update `wiki/glossary.md` with any new or refined terms
7. Update `wiki/index.md` — add new pages, update summaries of changed pages
8. Update `wiki/overview.md` if the source shifts the big picture
9. Append an entry to `wiki/log.md`:
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | <source title>
   Pages created: ...
   Pages updated: ...
   Key additions: ...
   ```

A single ingest may touch 5–15 wiki pages. That is expected.

### Query

When the user asks a question:

1. Read `wiki/index.md` to identify relevant pages
2. Read those pages
3. Synthesize a clear answer with citations to wiki pages
4. Ask: "Should I file this answer as a wiki page?" If yes, save it to `wiki/analyses/`
5. Append a log entry:
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD] query | <question summary>
   Pages consulted: ...
   Output filed: yes/no — <filename if yes>
   ```

### Lint

When the user says "lint the wiki":

1. Read all pages in the wiki
2. Report on:
   - Contradictions between pages
   - Stale claims superseded by newer sources
   - Orphan pages (no inbound links from other pages)
   - Concepts mentioned but lacking their own page
   - Missing cross-references that should exist
   - Terms used inconsistently across pages
3. Propose fixes and ask which ones to apply
4. Append a log entry:
   ```
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD] lint
   Issues found: ...
   Fixes applied: ...
   ```

---

## Cross-Referencing Convention

- Always use `[[filename-without-extension]]` for internal links
- When creating or updating a page, scan other relevant pages and add back-links
- The glossary and overview should link to every major entity page

---

## Terminology Discipline

- When a new term appears in a source, add it to `wiki/glossary.md`
- If a term conflicts with an existing glossary entry, flag it explicitly
- Always use the canonical term from the glossary in all wiki pages
- Note regional variants, deprecated terms, and preferred alternatives

---

## Output Formats

Depending on the query, you may produce:
- **Markdown page** — default for most outputs
- **Comparison table** — for side-by-side feature/product comparisons
- **Doc outline** — structured H1/H2/H3 skeleton ready for drafting
- **Release notes draft** — from ingested changelogs or feature specs
- **Persona brief** — structured summary for a specific audience segment
- **Style rule** — formatted entry ready to add to `wiki/style/`

Always ask the user which format they want if it's not clear.

---

## Session Start Checklist

At the start of every session:
1. Read this file (CLAUDE.md)
2. Read `wiki/index.md` to orient yourself
3. Read the last 5 entries in `wiki/log.md` to understand recent activity
4. Ask the user what they want to do: ingest, query, lint, or something else

---

## Notes

- Never guess terminology — always check `wiki/glossary.md` first
- If a source contradicts the wiki, flag the contradiction explicitly before updating
- Prefer updating existing pages over creating new ones when the content fits
- Keep page titles consistent with filenames (kebab-case for filenames)
- The wiki is a git repo of markdown — everything is versioned automatically
